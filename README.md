Personal website.

The theme in use is a custom version (modified by myself) of the [hacker theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/hacker/).

### Previewing the theme locally

If you'd like to preview the theme locally (for example, in the process of proposing a change):

1. Run `script/bootstrap` to install the necessary dependencies
2. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to start the preview server
3. Visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) in your browser to preview the theme

### Running tests
1. Run `script/bootstrap` to install the necessary dependencies
2. Run `script/cibuild`
