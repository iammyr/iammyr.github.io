I have [contributed](https://github.com/cve-search/cve-search/pull/341) to the open source project [cve-search](https://github.com/cve-search/cve-search/pulls) by adding a 
feature to scan pip requirements files for CVE (leveraging the [requirements-parser](https://pypi.org/project/requirements-parser/) tool, as well).

# How to use it

1. Install mongoDB. You might need to also add `require 'rubygems'` to the config file which on a mac (using brew) 
should be `/usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Taps/mongodb/homebrew-brew/Formula/mongodb-community.rb`
2. start mongoDB with `brew services start mongodb-community@4.0`
3. download cve-search `git clone git@github.com:cve-search/cve-search.git`
4. install its dependencies (better to use virtualenv but it's up to you): `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. run `./bin/search.py -q <path to the pip requirements file to scan>`
